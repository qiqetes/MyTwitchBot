# MyTwitchBot
Simple bot made to manage silly things in my small twitch channel.

## Make it run:
1. Download the project and install node.js in your computer
2. Type the command ~$ npm init
3. Change the file ChangeName.json to secret.json and fill it with your secret info.
4. Run the command ~$ node bot.js


## What it does?
- Greets people that join your channel
- List of commands implemented with !help
- Uptime

## TODO:
- Give points to frequent users
- Mod and ban commands
- Tell about what you are doing
- Say goodbye
- Alert when you gain a follower



Done using tmi.js and node.js
